2. **Vote Recording**  
   Votes stored in a local file or memory, with logic to block duplicate votes.

3. **Admin Interface**  
   Only admins can add/remove candidates and view current tallies.

4. **Result Display**  
   Real-time vote count shown in a dashboard bar or list format.

5. **Data Handling**  
   JSON files refresh on each vote or candidate update.
